# About

I am a first year Phd student in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/) at [Bar-Ilan University](http://cs.biu.ac.il), under the supervision of [Prof. Yoav Goldberg](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~yoavg/uni/).  
I also work as a research intern at [AI2 Israel](https://allenai.org/ai2-israel/).

My interests lie between Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.
